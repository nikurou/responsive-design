# Responsive Design Practice Demo

A short single page application meant to practice Responsive web design by using media queries and flexbox. My own solution/take on Kevin Powell's course problem listed below. This did not need to be a React App or have MUI, but I made it one as it usually is the framework/libary I work with the most.

# Notes for Future Reference:

_I'll use this page as a notebook for future review/cheatsheet_

1. Design the "Big Picture" First
   - Outline your divs, and its structure before doing the css or making it responsive
   - Often diving into the complexities first leads to a lot of extra CSS styling that is repetitive
   - Figure out layout, fonts, and etc first before going on to make it responsive/flexbox
